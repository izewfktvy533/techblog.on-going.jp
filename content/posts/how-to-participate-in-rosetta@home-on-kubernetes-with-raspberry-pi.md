Hello, I'm [@izewfktvy](https://twitter.com/izewfktvy).

Last month, I made Kubernetes manifests and Docker containers to participate in [Rosetta@home project](https://boinc.bakerlab.org/) with Raspberry Pi Kubernetes Cluster.

Rosetta@home is a distributed computing project for protein structure prediction on the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) platform, run by the Baker laboratory at the University of Washington.
This project recently added [support for fighting COVID-19](https://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/forum_thread.php?id=13702).

If you have your RasPi K8s cluster, you can help analyzing COVID-19 through pariticipating in Rosetta@home project by using this Kubernetes manifests. 

If you are interested, please check [follow link](https://github.com/izewfktvy533zjmn/raspi-k8s-rah) that GitHub repository.

On this link, mentions prerequisites and how to use, so on.
